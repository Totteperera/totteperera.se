MTP Consulting is owned by me, and I'm working as a freelance C# .Net developer.

<b>Some projects:</b> <br/>

<a href="https://a-mobler.no">A-Møbler</a> E-commerce solution built on top of <a href="https://www.litium.se/">Litium</a>. A-Møbler was a fun project to work with since they have a relative complex solution, that didn't 100% map to Litium, which meant we had to make some customizations. I mostly helped with their integration between their E-com and ERP, but also implemented the price calculation for their product configurator.
