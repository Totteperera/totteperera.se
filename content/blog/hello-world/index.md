Hello friends!

I've always wanted my own website, and now I got one, thanks to me.

I created it using GatsbyJS and React, mostly for the purpose of learning a new technology.

Why did i create a blog? I don't know, maybe to do something outside my comfort zone.


I'll leave you with a clip of Joe Rogan talking to Roe Jogan.
